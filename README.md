## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'M Salah Marabou ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer looking to solve real-world problems. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible.
If you found value in something I created, feel free to reach out to me  or give me a bit of â™¥ via email. Don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to get in touch as well.

-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a comprehensive product management system with end-to-end automation to ensure scalability and adaptability.

-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced integration techniques with technologies like Redux for state management and exploring the optimization of data management and system performance using frameworks such as SpringBoot.

-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative platform design projects, particularly those aimed at streamlining job and internship offer distribution and management, as well as on developing advanced reservation systems with intuitive user interfaces.
